The AMD CPU Services (ACS) library provides software developers with the ability to query AMD CPU software and hardware state information that is not normally available through standard operating systems or graphics APIs.  If you are serious about getting the most from your AMD CPU, then ACS can help you harness that power.

Also, check (todo: insert link) for any updates and articles on ACS.
