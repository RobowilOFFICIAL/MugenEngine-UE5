# NOTICE OF PERMANENT DISCONTINUATION
As of May 24, 2025, this has been permanently discontinued, and work will no longer be done on this. To be completely blunt, I was getting sick of constantly being given feature requests + issues on something I outright hated for a variety of reasons, so the only real way I could escape that was to completely stop development.

You are free to fork this and modify it as you see fit, however.

That said, I would highly advise using something like [DashEngine 1.3](https://github.com/YakuzaBalooza/Dash-Engine-1.3) instead, which is far better-developed than the Infinity Engine could have ever hoped to be.

# MugenEngine-UE5
The Sonic Infinity Engine by Oban (which was infamously used for the terrible fan-game Sonic Omens), ported to Unreal Engine 5 based on the Max & Adam build. Requires Unreal Engine 5.5.4 or higher.

## Changes besides the obvious upgrade from UE4 to UE5:
- The controls mapping has been changed to match Sonic X Shadow Generations. Boost is now mapped to the right trigger, and jumps/homing attacks can now be done on both A and X. Shadow's chaos control has been mapped to the left trigger.
- [AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution 3.1.3a](https://gpuopen.com/learn/ue-fsr3/) is now utilized.
- Sonic and Shadow's materials/textures have been changed to better match their appearances in Sonic Frontiers and Shadow Generations.
- GUN Hunters and Beetles now use their materials/textures from Shadow Generations.
- Made the landscape in the test area themed after Green Hill. ;)
- Toned down the excessive motion blur.
- Deleted some unused files.
- UI elements are now properly in the "UI" texture group.
- Rainbow ring behavior has been adjusted to match the actual Sonic games. Now, they no longer revert to standard dash rings.
